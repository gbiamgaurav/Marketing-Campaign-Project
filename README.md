## Project Overview
Marketing campaigns are essential for businesses to promote their products and engage customers. Predicting the success of these campaigns can save resources and improve targeting strategies. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of marketing campaigns based on historical data.


## Data Source
The dataset can be downloaded from [This Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujithmandala/marketing-campaign-positive-response-prediction).




## Clone the Repository
```git clone https://github.com/gbiamgaurav/Marketing-Campaign-Project.git```


## Run the following commands
```bash init_setup.sh```



## Feature Engineering
We perform feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of our models:

* Encoding categorical variables
* Scaling numerical features




## Model Building
The project uses several machine learning algorithms to build predictive models, including:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)



## Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1 Score
* ROC AUC
