## Project Overview
Marketing campaigns are essential for businesses to promote their products and engage customers. Predicting the success of these campaigns can save resources and improve targeting strategies. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the outcome of marketing campaigns based on historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of historical data from various marketing campaigns. It 

## Data Source
The dataset can be downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

## Clone the Repository
```git clone https://github.com/gbiamgaurav/Marketing-Campaign-Project.git```


## Run the following commands
```bash init_setup.sh```



## Model Building
The project uses several machine learning algorithms to build predictive models, including:
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Feature Engineering
We perform feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of our models:

Encoding categorical variables
Scaling numerical features
Creating interaction terms

## Model Training
We use scikit-learn to train and evaluate our models. The training script (train.py) includes hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

## Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
ROC AUC
